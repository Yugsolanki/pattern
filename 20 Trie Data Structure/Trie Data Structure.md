# Trie Data Structure

## 1. Concise Explanation

A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used to store and retrieve strings efficiently. It's particularly useful for tasks involving prefix matching, autocomplete, and spell-checking. Each node in the trie represents a character, and paths from the root to leaf nodes form complete words or strings.

## 2. Detailed Walkthrough

Let's walk through the process of building a trie with the words: "cat", "car", "dog".

1. Start with an empty root node.

2. Insert "cat":
   - Create a node for 'c' as a child of the root
   - Create a node for 'a' as a child of 'c'
   - Create a node for 't' as a child of 'a'
   - Mark 't' as the end of a word

3. Insert "car":
   - 'c' and 'a' nodes already exist, so reuse them
   - Create a node for 'r' as a child of 'a'
   - Mark 'r' as the end of a word

4. Insert "dog":
   - Create a node for 'd' as a child of the root
   - Create a node for 'o' as a child of 'd'
   - Create a node for 'g' as a child of 'o'
   - Mark 'g' as the end of a word

Final structure:
```
       root
      /    \
     c      d
    /        \
   a          o
  / \          \
 t   r          g
```

To search for a word, we traverse the trie from the root, following the path corresponding to each character in the word. If we reach the end of the word and the last node is marked as the end of a word, the search is successful.

## 3. Code Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of a basic Trie:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True
    
    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word
    
    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True

# Example usage
trie = Trie()
trie.insert("cat")
trie.insert("car")
trie.insert("dog")

print(trie.search("cat"))  # True
print(trie.search("ca"))   # False
print(trie.starts_with("ca"))  # True
```

## 4. Applications

Tries are effective for:

1. Autocomplete and predictive text
2. Spell checkers
3. IP routing (longest prefix matching)
4. Dictionary implementations
5. Prefix matching in string searches

They're most effective when:
- You need to perform operations on a large set of strings
- Prefix matching is a common operation
- Memory usage is not a critical constraint (tries can be memory-intensive)
- Fast lookup times are crucial

## 5. Practice Problems

### Easy Problems (Least to Most Important)

1. Implement a trie with insert, search, and startsWith methods
2. Count the number of words in a trie
3. Print all words stored in a trie
4. Find the longest common prefix of a set of strings
5. Implement an autocomplete system using a trie

### Medium Problems (Least to Most Important)

1. Implement a spell checker using a trie
2. Find all words in a trie that match a given pattern (where '.' can be any letter)
3. Implement a trie using a compressed trie (where nodes with only one child are merged)
4. Design a data structure that supports adding new words and finding the shortest unique prefix of a word
5. Implement a word break problem solver using a trie

### Difficult Problems (Least to Most Important)

1. Implement a trie-based solution for storing and querying 2D coordinates
2. Design a data structure for storing strings that supports fast prefix search and most frequently queried results
